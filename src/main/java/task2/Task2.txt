Task 2. Dynamic Array

Create your own DynamicDoubleArray class containing a double [] array inside that supports adding an element to the end of the array (add), 
getting an element by index (get), printing the internal state (toString), removing an arbitrary element by index (remove), as well as 
the ability set the initial size when calling the constructor. When the number of elements changes, the internal array must be recreated. 
Parameterize the class by letting it store an array of elements of any type.
